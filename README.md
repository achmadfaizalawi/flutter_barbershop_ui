# Flutter Barbershop UI

This is the **development/v1** branch, developments that have been carried out include:
1. Creating a home page.
2. Create animated features on select day and select barber, then create features on select time and select type of treatment.

## Reference

In the UI slicing process I took design references from the [YouTube](https://youtu.be/WSlbqb5dDeA?si=3l0w5-K6bw8g4TGv) platform.
