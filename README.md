# Flutter Barbershop UI

This is the **development/v1** branch, developments that have been carried out include:
1. Creating a home page.
2. Create animated features on select day and select barber, then create features on select time and select type of treatment.

## Usage

1. To select the day and time of the hair treatment, you can press the day and time buttons.
2. To select a barber, press the barber's photo. The selected barber has a green box.
3. More than one type of hair treatment can be selected depending on the user's needs.

## Reference

In the UI slicing process I took design references from the [YouTube](https://youtu.be/WSlbqb5dDeA?si=3l0w5-K6bw8g4TGv) platform.
